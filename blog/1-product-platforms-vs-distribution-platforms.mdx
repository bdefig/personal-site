In 2007, Bill Gates looked at Facebook and [said](https://semilshah.com/2015/09/17/transcript-chamath-at-strictlyvcs-insider-series/), "This isn’t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it."

The interesting thing is that, by his own definition, Gates was wrong about Facebook.
He was spot on about the power of platforms and their strong network effects—but he was so focused on building products that he ignored the other ways participants derive value from platforms.
What he didn't consider is that platforms can solve different [jobs to be done](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/jobs-to-be-done/) beyond product development.
Let's look at two of these jobs and why it's important to distinguish between different types of platforms.

## Two Categories of Platforms

There's a truism in tech that each new platform is an opportunity for a new generation of startups.
This is true, but not always in the obvious way.
Platforms are not all created equally—some are terrible for building products on top of.
Here we'll look at two types of platforms: product platforms and distribution platforms.

Product platforms enable developers to build experiences on top of them, while distribution platforms facilitate business growth.
Although the two aren't mutually exclusive, most platforms tend to be good for one or the other.
This is really important, as founders routinely bet their companies on a particular platform.
Fortunes are made and lost on these platform bets, so understanding a platform's potential is one of the most important questions to answer for startups.

## Product Platforms

Product platforms enable great products to be built on top of them.
Think of Windows, the iPhone, and the internet.
Product platforms are great because they unlock capabilities that developers didn't have access to before.
Modern operating systems abstracted away PC hardware so that programmers could write code once and have it run on a huge variety of machines.
Billions of dollars of value have been created by products built on top of the Windows platform.
Similarly, the iPhone gave app developers access to a platform that was always with the user and had GPS, camera, and a touchscreen built in.
Without smartphones as a platform, a company like Uber never could have become what it is today.

Product platforms are important because the products built on top of them can provide users with enough value to sustain huge businesses.
In each technology wave, the market typically ends up being dominated by just one to a handful of product platforms.
In personal computers, it was Windows.
In mobile, it was iOS and Android.
In cloud, it was AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
These are the types of platforms that engineers and product people tend to think of because they're the ones they directly use to build their products.

## Distribution Platforms

However, there is another kind of platform: the Distribution Platform.
Distribution platforms also enable large businesses to be built, but in a fundamentally different way.
Rather than providing the technical infrastructure to build products, distribution platforms enable products to spread and marketers to reach their customers.
Facebook, Twitter, and Google are distribution platforms.
While it's possible to build apps on top of the Facebook API, the platform's real value comes from the sharing and discovery that happens there.
Outside of Zynga, there haven't been many large companies built on top of a social network's API.
In contrast, think about all the companies that have been built on top of Facebook ads and social sharing.

## What Bill Gates Got Wrong

When Bill Gates said that Facebook wasn't a platform, he was looking at what Facebook was calling "the Facebook Platform"—tools and services that let developers build apps and games on top of its social graph (remember [FarmVille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FarmVille)?).
But by focusing just on the Facebook Platform, he missed the point.
Sure, Facebook isn't a great developer platform.
But consider the company as a whole.
If we think about how much value has been created by leveraging the distribution that happens on Facebook, we see a very different picture.
BuzzFeed (the website) could have been built if Facebook never existed.
But could BuzzFeed (the business) ever have achieved the scale and reach it did without the social network?
Probably not.

Ben Thompson would say that [Facebook isn't a platform, but is instead an aggregator](https://stratechery.com/2018/the-bill-gates-line/).
I disagree.
Facebook's position as an aggregator is clear, but that doesn't mean that it's not also a distribution platform.
In fact, it's probably the most clear example of a distribution platform that exists today.
Facebook is a platform because of the huge economic value it supports—it's just that the value is created through distribution rather than product APIs.

## Why It Matters

So is the difference between product and distribution platforms just a semantic one?
People write these types of taxonomy posts all the time trying to sound smart, but at the end of the day, it only matters if it impacts a real person's decision making.
The difference between product and distribution platforms is important because it informs entrepreneurs, investors, and operators about the types of opportunities they should pursue in new platforms.
When a new platform arises, the question isn't just, "Is this a good platform to build on?", it's "Is this a better platform for product development or for product distribution?".

## Some Examples

### Slack

In 2015, Slack launched its platform, with an API, app framework, and app directory.
If you were an entrepreneur in 2015, would you 1) build a new product on top of Slack, or 2) build an independent product and use Slack as a distribution channel to grow organically?
This isn't an open-and-shut case, but on balance, Slack appears to be more valuable as a distribution platform.
More companies have had success integrating their own products with Slack to facilitate sharing and growth.
In the 7 years of its existence, I haven't seen many large businesses built on top of Slack.
(Compare this with Salesforce, which has an entire ecosystem of businesses built on top of it.)

### The Metaverse

In 2021 when Facebook [changed its name to Meta](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/), it made a big deal about [the metaverse being the next big platform](https://tech.fb.com/ar-vr/2021/10/connect-2021-our-vision-for-the-metaverse/).
Thousands of entrepreneurs and VCs licked their lips at the idea of a new platform they could build on.
But the critical question was, would the metaverse become a product platform or a distribution platform?

Most obviously, VR hardware is a new product platform—it has the potential to be transformative in gaming and content consumption.
But the way Mark Zuckerberg and others are pitching it, they expect the metaverse to be a distribution platform as well.
The idea is that people will be hanging out, socializing, and sharing connections within the metaverse.
Meta and others still have a long way to go to convince the general public to do much more in VR than hop in, play a game or watch a video, and take the headset off.
In other words, VR is a new product platform, and the other part of the metaverse (a hypothetical distribution platform) has yet to play out.

## What's Next?

Major new platforms only come around at most once every few years.
When they do, there's a flurry of activity, but lots of people get them wrong at first.
Asking whether a new platform is great for product development or product distribution is an important first step to taking advantage of it to the fullest.
